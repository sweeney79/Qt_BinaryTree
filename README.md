# Qt_BinaryTree
Display of a binary tree using custom widgets in Qt and C++. Developed using Visual Studio Professional 2013 and Qt 5.9.

To build the .exe, I opened the .sln file in Visual Studio Professional 2013 (using Qt 5.9) and chose Release mode and then bulld the solution.

There is a pre-built BinaryTree.exe located in the "Windows_EXE" folder of this repo.
The .exe file has had Qt's windeployqt.exe tool run on it, so it should have the dependencies to run in the "Windows_EXE" folder. 
To run the .exe, copy the entire "Windows_EXE" folder to your own workstation and double-click the file "BinaryTree.exe"!
